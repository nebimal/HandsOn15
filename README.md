## Dijkstra's Algorithm Output 
Shortest distances from source node A  
Distance to A: 0  
Distance to B: 4  
Distance to C: 3  
Distance to D: 9  
Distance to E: 7  
Distance to F: 11  
Distance to G: 12  
Shortest path from A to G: ['A', 'E', 'G']
## Bellman-Ford Algorithm Output
Shortest distances from source node S  
Distance to S: 0  
Distance to T: 2  
Distance to X: 4  
Distance to Y: 7  
Distance to Z: -2  
Shortest path from S to Z: ['S', 'Y', 'X', 'T', 'Z']
## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Output
Shortest path matrix:  
[[ 0.  5. 10. 15.]  
 [inf  0.  5. 10.]  
 [inf inf  0.  5.]  
 [inf inf inf  0.]]
